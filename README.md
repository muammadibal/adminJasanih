# [Jasanih Simple Dashboard]

This is jasanih admin dashboard using [react paper dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard-2).

**Bootstrap 4 Support** This Dashboard is built on top of the much awaited Bootstrap 4 and uses the most used react framework that implements the Bootstrap 4 components on react, reactstrap. This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 and/or reactstrap project; you can just import the Paper Dashboard React style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.

**Firestore web v9 Support** Using firebase for the dummy backend for bootstrapping your application and show it to the world or production is the best option. This is lit because the authentication and the database are documented well. So it easy to implemented in your project.
